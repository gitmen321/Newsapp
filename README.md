Features:

HTTP API Integration: Fetches news data from a reliable and well-documented HTTP API (replace with the specific API you'll use).
News Listing: Displays a list of news articles with relevant information (title, source, category, etc.).
Article Details: Allows users to navigate to a dedicated page for each article, providing additional details and potentially an image.
Customizable UI (Optional): Offers options to personalize the news experience (e.g., font size, dark mode).
